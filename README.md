I'm currently a cybersecurity student at West Virginia University with a strong passion for threat analysis and prevention. I'm actively expanding my knowledge through hands-on projects, academic coursework, and independent research.

## Objective


My early background in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to explore more in this field. I'm particularly interested in joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply my skills in threat detection, analysis, and incident response to help defend against cyber threats.
